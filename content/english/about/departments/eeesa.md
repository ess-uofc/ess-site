The Energy and Environment Engineering Studentsâ€™ Association (EEESA) was established in 2008, as the main student body for students enrolled in the Energy and Environment (ENEE) specialization, now known as the Energy and Environment minor. The ENEE minor is open to students in most engineering majors, and as such both EEESA and the entire ENEE program are very interdisciplinary. Students are united by common interests in the environment, renewable energy, sustainable development, and the future of the energy industry. EEESA offers many academic, industry, and social events throughout the year, which allows students to learn more about topics related to ENEE, explore ENEE-related jobs, facilities, and research positions, and meet other students with similar interests and goals. Events organized by EEESA take place throughout the year, and include an internship panel, resume review, academic/industry lunch-and-learns, day trips to various plants and facilities around Calgary, and more. EEESA also hosts an international trip every year, where previous destinations have included San Francisco, Zurich, Copenhagen, Munich, and Vienna. If you have any questions about EEESA, please contact eeesa@ucalgary.ca. You can also find more information on our Instagram page (@uofc_eeesa) or on our website: https://www.eeesaucalgary.com/.
