The University of Calgary's Electrical and Software Engineering Students' Society, affectionally referred to as ZOO, is an initiative run by students, for students. ZOO aims to support their undergraduate students, both academically and socially, by providing them with a variety of events to enrich their University experience. Through the Society, we hope assist students in clearing the gap between university and industry.

In addition to those responsibilities, ZOO serves as a liaison between the Department (ESE) and the many Electrical, Software and Computer Engineering students. We work hard to represent your opinions and ensure that your voices are heard.

Any inquiries for ZOO can be voiced in-person in ENA 106, or via email to execs@zooengg.ca. We will attempt to answer questions to the best of our ability and if necessary, direct you to the relevant Department employee.
