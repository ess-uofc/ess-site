Hey Hey Hey, I am Abod. I am entering my third year of my double major in ELectrical Engineering and Computer Science. Most of what I do as sustainability comissioner is ensure that sustainability is being considered in all aspects of ESS operations. I do this through finding new ways in which ESS can be more environmentally sustainable in the broader engineering community. When I am not doing my homework, I love to play and also watch soccer and basketball. I also like travelling when I have time. Can't wait to meet you all, and please dont hesitate to reach out to me if you have any ideas or suggestions for how to make schulich more sustainable reach out to me @sustainability@essucalgary.com. Otherwie, I hope you have a safe and enjoyable year ahead of you!!
