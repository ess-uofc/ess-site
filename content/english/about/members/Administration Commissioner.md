Hi everyone, I'm Pamela but you can call me Pam and I will be your Administration Commissioner this year here at the ESS. A little bit about me: I am entering my second year, going into Biomedical Engineering, so I'm both excited and nervous. This is my first year on the ESS and I am ready to make every minute count. If there is one thing I like it is going on adventures for destressing (fugas, iykyk) so you will probably see me walking around campus or the city really - don't be afraid to say hi :) Anyways, I am excited to be part of your council this year, wishing you all the best and don't forget to appreciate the little things.
