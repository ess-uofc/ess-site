Hi! My name is Amber and I am so excited to be your VP Communications this year! I'll be ensuring engineering students stay in the loop and are engaged, whether it be through social media, email, or any other platform. I'm a second year biomedical engineering student with a minor in digital engineering, but who wants to talk about school? For fun, I love to play rugby, ski, and travel. Feel free to reach out (email above!) or if you see me in the hall be sure to say hi!
