Hey everyone! Welcome to Schulich and ESS! My name is Ana and I am a third-year Software Engineering student. I’m originally from Brazil, but I moved to Calgary when I was 8 years old and I have been living here ever since! I remember how scary yet exciting my first year of university was, so whether you’re from Brazil, Canada or anywhere in this big big world, feel free to reach out to me if you ever want to chat! I absolutely love meeting new people, so if you see me around, please feel free to say hi!
