Hello everyone!! My name is Ariana Miller and I am one of your social commissioners this upcoming year. I'm going into my second year of a Mechanical Engineering major with a Digital minor. Beyond cramming last minute for exams, you can find me cooking, hitting the gym, and writing and listening to music! I'm excited to see what the future holds with my position here and to get to know the student body in the next months! I'm always open to meeting new friends and sharing ideas about what you'd like to see happening in the upcoming ESS events. Feel free to come say hi if you see me around campus :)
