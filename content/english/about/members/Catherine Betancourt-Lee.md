Hi :) My name is Catherine and I am excited to be your VP Corporate Relations this year! Formally known as “email girl” I’ll be helping students this year progress their professional skills through different connections with sponsors and companies so keep your eye out for awesome networking events! I’m a third year biomedical engineering student that loves to help people and make their day brighter in one way or another. In my free time I love to vibe, volunteer, stay active, drink way too much coffee and be way too busy all the time. I’ve always loved meeting new people and I’m here to help so if you ever need anything don’t hesitate to reach out!
