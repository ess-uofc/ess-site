Hi :) My name is Catherine and I am excited to be your VP Communications this year! I’ll be helping students get all the right information through different mediums, to make sure everyone has access to the same opportunities. I am a second year Biomedical engineering student, who started off as a first year rep last year and wanted to keep being involved with such an amazing community. Whether it be volunteering in and outside of the university, research, or advocating with my other clubs I’m always keeping myself busy in one way or another. I’m super outgoing and energetic with a positive attitude, where my goal is to make someone’s day brighter in any way possible! I’ve always loved meeting new people and dedicating my time to helping anyone, so if you ever need anything don’t hesitate to reach out!
