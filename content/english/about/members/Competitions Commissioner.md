My name is Evan Bosdet, I'm going into my second year of engineering with a focus on electrical engineering. I love working with teams and individually to explore my passions like music, design, technology, and student government. This year with ESS I'll be your Competitions Commissioner, which means I'll be working to facilitate all student competitions ran through ESS, with the help of my other council members of course. Looking forward to an exciting year of competitions and courses!
