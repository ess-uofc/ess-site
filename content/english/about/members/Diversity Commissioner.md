Hey everyone! I'm Donna, and I'm super excited to be your Diversity Commissioner for the 2023-2024 academic school year. I'm in my third year of Chemical Engineering with a minor in energy and environment. I absolutely love going for walks and snapping pics of the pretty skies. Spending time with my family and friends is the best, and I'm always up for trying out new and delicious foods. Can't wait to work with the council and make some new connections! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
