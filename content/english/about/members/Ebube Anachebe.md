Hello! My name is Ebube and I am currently the Interim VP Academic for the 2023-2024 school year - hopefully I will be joining long term :). I am in my 3rd year of Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering. In my free time, you will probably find me trying to learn a new skill, playing one of my various musical instruments, singing, or just being a curious person trying to learn something new! If you have not already noticed, I love learning! I am looking forward to working on ESS this year to better support students. I love meeting new people so if you see me, please do not hesitate to say hi! Itâ€™s always a pleasure meeting other students!
