Hello everyone! My name is Ella Johnson, and I am the Sponsorship Commissioner for the upcoming year. My role primarily involves connecting with potential sponsors to help support ESS for the academic year. My favourite part about the ESS is how I get to interact with the campus community. I love how ESS offers incredibly unique and diverse experiences to the student body. I’m going into my second year of a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering and Business. In my spare time I like to read, play piano, bake, play Stardew Valley, and volunteer. I work during the school year, teaching piano to all levels, and ages. This year, I’m excited to explore new ideas and events with ESS. I’m extremely energetic, outgoing, and caffeinated. I love to meet new people, so don’t be afraid to stop and chat if you see me around!
