**The one thing you should know about me** is that I HATE being non-chalant.
**I get way too excited about** cheese (even tho i'm lactose), I will see cheese and want it, I will crave cheese, I will dream about cheese. I am made of Cheese.
**My cry-in-the-car song** is literally ANY Daniel Caesar song!!!
