**This year, I really want** to make new friends :)

**I get way too excited about** Redbull. My favourite thing about Calgary is that there’s way more flavours of Redbull. It’s my comfort food. It’s the only thing you can bribe me with and the only thing that keeps me awake past 5pm.

**Unusual skill:** I can play the trumpet and the flugelhorn
