Hello! My name is Fabiha Chohan and I am the incoming VP Corporate Relations at ESS. I am going into my third year of Biomedical Engineering with a minor in digital. This summer, I have been collaborating with industry professionals to facilitate engagement, collaboration and networking opportunities for the students. I have also worked with our community partners to provide awesome benefits to our students. I can't wait for another year of awesome events that we have planned! In my free time, I love to stay active, be outdoors and hang out with my friends!
