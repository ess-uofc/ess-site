Hey! I’m Fabiha, I am an incoming second year Biomedical Engineering student with a minor in Digital Engineering. I’m the Community Relations Commissioner for the academic year 2022-2023. I have been working with our community partners to help bring benefits and discounts for all our engineering students that hold an ESS membership! I am also a very outgoing person who loves to be involved in the engineering community by being part of different clubs. This is also my first time being part of ESS and I am so excited for this new journey!
