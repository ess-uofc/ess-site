Hello everyone! I’m Shannon, and I am this year’s Finance Commissioner. I’m in my second year of electrical engineering. I’m really excited to be part of ESS this school year! As the Finance Commissioner, I am responsible for the administration and management of the SELF fund - an amazing source of funding for Schulich clubs and teams. In my free time, I like to play music and explore nature. If you ever see me, feel free to stop by and say hello! :)
