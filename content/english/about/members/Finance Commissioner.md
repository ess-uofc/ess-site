**Year & Major:** 2nd Year - Electrical

**A life goal of mine...** Own a company that does something (irrelevant) but also has a speakeasy/cafe beneath it. No, I don't want to just run a speakeasy/cafe, that's not the point.

**I get way too excited about...** dancing at Ranchmens

**Unusual skills...** I can perfectly cook pork every single time.
