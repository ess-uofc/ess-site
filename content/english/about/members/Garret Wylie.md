Hello everyone, as you can see above my name is Garret. I am currently entering my 2nd year in Schulich and have chosen Civil Engineering as my major. The Artistic Commissioners role on ESS is to design any visuals that the council needs. This is mainly event posters/Instagram posts, but my role will also include things like the yearbook cover, and most of the visuals that you can see in this years Cogwheel. I grew up playing lots of sports, and still really enjoy all physical activities. More specifically, activities in the outdoors such as hiking/backpacking have won my heart. I wish everyone the best of luck during their semester! And if you see spelling errors on any posters this year, no you didn't. GW
