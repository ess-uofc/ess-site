Hey everyone! I'm Hiten Mahalwar, a 3rd year Software Eng major with a Biomedical Eng minor. I was previously a first year rep (keep your eye out for applications for that position) and last year I was the community relations commissioner. This year I'll be helping with all of ESS's digital initiatives and expanding ESS outreach. Make sure to check out our website for all the latest ESS news. Outside of school, I love playing basketball, soccer, and hiking, as well as messing around with interesting technology. Feel free to say hi if you see me around!
