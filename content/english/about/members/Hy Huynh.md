Hi, my name is Hy Huynh. I am in my 3rd year Software Engineering and will be your Technology Commissioner for 2021-2022. My responsibility will be maintaining ESS website as well as developing the amazing projects along side with our VP Technology. The programming journey to visualize my personality has just begun, and this opportunity is one of my very first stops. So, I am super excited to explore new things and new me in this academic year, and will do my best to give you unforgettable moments in ESS's community.
