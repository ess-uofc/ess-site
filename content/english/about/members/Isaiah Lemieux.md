Wadduuup! I'm Isaiah, and I'll be your Publications Commissioner this year. My role essentially involves helping out both the VP and the Artistic Commissioner wherever they need it... basically the Swiss Army knife of the Communications team. I'm entering my 3rd year of Software Engineering and I'm excited to get back into it! I love hockey (go habs), Formula 1 (go lewis), movies, and anything to do with nature. If you see me on campus, I'll probably be listening to music, but definitely come and say hi anyways!
