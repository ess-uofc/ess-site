Hi everybody! My name is Jesse, and I am a Fourth Year Electrical Engineering Student! I've just finished my internship, and am looking forward to returning to the university and seeing all the new faces that I've missed since quarantine began. I was born in Calgary, so I have a soft spot for the city, and am passionate about seeing students get involved and make the most of their university degree. During my downtime, I play video games, read fiction novels, and sleep way too much. I can't wait to see you all, and please feel free to come by the ESS office and say hi!
