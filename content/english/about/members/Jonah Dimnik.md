Heyo! My name is Jonah, and I will be your Sustainability Commissioner for this upcoming year. In general, my goal is to find different ways that ESS can promote sustainability within their events and help us work towards a more sustainable future. You can also keep an eye out for some events with a specific focus on sustainability. This year we are hoping to make ESS a Net Zero organization by reducing our carbon footprint and offsetting our travel related carbon emissions. I look forward to seeing you all participate in the events we have planned for this year!
