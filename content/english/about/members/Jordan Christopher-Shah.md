As the PD Comissioner, I hope to leverage my experience coming back from Internship and previously holding this role to build off of previous years. My aim is to bring more opportunities for students to learn about the industry, develop their professional skills and feel prepared for their futures. Some of my main events are the PD Fair, Mock Interviews, and information sessions with companies and past interns. Outside of ESS I study Electrical Engineer w/ a Biomedical Eng minor. I also write, produce and play music with my band, work on art and graphic design and love playing sports (bball especially) and working out. Always looking for new experiences.
