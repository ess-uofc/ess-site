Hey, I'm Michael Kohlman and I am this year's Finance Commissioner for ESS. In this role, I oversee the application and selection processes for SELF, which provides funding for engineering projects and clubs. I also help out with SSAF funding applications on behalf of ESS, and during the school year you can sometimes find me helping out in the ESS Office. When I'm away from school, I enjoy skiing, stock market investing, and dirt biking.
