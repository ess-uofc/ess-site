Hi there! My name is Michelle and I’m in my second year of Electrical Engineering. I’m so excited to be your VPX this year! I was a First Year Rep last year and Publications Commissioner over the summer, so I’m thrilled to be back on the council with so many inspiring people. As VPX, I represent the University of Calgary Engineering Students’ Society to two national organizations, the Western Engineering Student Societies’ Team (WESST) and Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES). In my free time, I love reading, travelling, meeting new people, and getting involved in the community. Come and say hi if you see me around campus!
