Hi everyone, welcome to Schulich! My name is Michelle and Iâ€™m in my third year of electrical engineering with a computer engineering minor. As your VP Internal, I will be working on designing merchandise, organizing the grad banquet, and developing student engagement initiatives to connect you with clubs and opportunities. I also oversee the diversity and sustainability commissioners on ESS. I love reading, travelling, and meeting new people! Come say hi if you see me around campus, and I hope you have a great year!
