Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Mufaro and I am super excited to be your VP Academic this year. I am in 3rd year Software Engineering and I enjoy playing soccer and basketball in my free time. As VP Academic, I responsible for being a liaison between you (the student body) and the faculty staff. I also oversee a lot of the academic, professional and mental health events that ESS runs. Please do not hesitate to contact me for anything you might need in regards to my portfolio or ESS in general or even if you just want to chat and network!
