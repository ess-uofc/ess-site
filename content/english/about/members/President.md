Hola todos! My name is Avi and I'm your ESS President for this year! I'm going into my 5th year of Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace. I'm super grateful for the opportunity to be the leader of this student society. We have so many exciting things planned for this year and we can't wait to share them with you all! ESS has a lot to offer, so feel free to come by the office and ask anyone what we can do for you. In my personal life, I just finished an internship at Stantec. During the summers, I love to golf and during the winters, I love to snowboard. You will also catch me running around campus so, feel free to stop me and say hi! I would love to talk and get to know you all! Have a wonderful year!
