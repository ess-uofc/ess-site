Hi! My name is Saachi, and I am in my second year of Mechanical Engineering. I am so excited to be the Professional Development Commissioner for this school year. I'll be focusing on giving our student body access to opportunities that help strengthen their professional skills and connection to the industries that we'll all be joining soon. I hope to host many interactive events, including the Professional Development Fair. Outside of ESS and school, I love spending time with my friends, going on hikes, and listening to music. I hope to see everyone around campus!
