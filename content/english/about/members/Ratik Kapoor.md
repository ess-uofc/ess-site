Hi everyone, I'm Ratik and your ESS President for this year! I'm in my final year of Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering. I'm so excited to see everyone lively on campus again and for what's to come this year. I encourage you to take full advantage of all the services ESS offers and to come out to the events that we host! Outside of ESS, you can find me working on cars, hacking together software projects, taking my mountain bike out on trails, or playing with my dog Teddy! Come say hi if you see me walking around campus or shoot me an email at president@essucalgary.com! I'd love to meet as many of you as I can!
