Hi y’all :) My name is Rayna and I am a second year mechanical engineering student. I’m excited to be your diversity commissioner this year. I'll be working this year to create fun and inclusive events for students to attend, as well as supplying information regarding diversity to ESS and the student body. Outside of school, I love to do sports like martial arts and rugby. You can always find me watching the sunset or doing a random art project. If you see me around come say hi, I look forward to meeting you all!
