Hey everyone, I'm Robert and I am currently entering my third year in Software Engineering. As the VP Technology, I am responsible for the management of everything tech for ess such as the website and emails. We have some cool projects we are working on in order to make the services that ESS offers more accessible to you. Would love to chat about personal projects and how we can make our tech better. Feel free to email me at my council email.
