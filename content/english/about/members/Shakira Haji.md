Hey y'all! I'm Shakira (yes, like the singer) and I'm your Publications Commissioner for this year! I'll be entering my second year of biomedical engineering with a digital minor. My role primarily involves making sure you guys are informed about engineering related events and important opportunities. So, when you get an email from me, be sure not to ignore it!!! I'm excited to work on the ESS council this year with my wonderful colleagues, and we will do our best to represent our fellow engineering student body!
