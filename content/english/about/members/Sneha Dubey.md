Hey everyone! I’m Sneha, your VP Finance for the 2022-2023 school year. I’m a second year Geomatics Engineering student with a minor in Software Engineering. Some of the main things I do for council are funding events, competitions/conferences and manage the overall budget. It is my goal for all students to have the best experience with ESS and engineering, so I do my best to fund all of our activities. I love to read, travel and meet new people. Feel free to wave to me in the hallways or drop by the ESS Office!! :)
