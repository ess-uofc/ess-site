Hi everyone! My name is Riya and I’m an incoming second year Software Engineering student with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I’ll be your Sponsorship Commissioner for the 2023-2024 academic year! I have been connecting with potential ESS sponsors to support us during the upcoming year. I am part of a few campus clubs, and outside of school I love volunteering throughout the community, staying active, and I’m also a Bollywood dancer/dance teacher! We have a lot planned for this year and I’m really excited about it - I hope you are too!
