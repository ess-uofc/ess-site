My name is Stephan Babak and I am one of the student life commissioners. I am in my second year of Mechanical Engineering with a Digital Minor. I will be running many events along side my VP and the other commissioner this year. Come have fun and destress from the year that is about to swallow us alive. Feel free to contact me or my fellow ESSers and come by the office (I swear we donâ€™t bite).
