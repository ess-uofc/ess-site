Heyo! I'm Camilla and I'm your Sustainability Commissioner this year! I'm going into my 5th of Mechanical Engineering with a Digital Minor. In my free time, I really enjoy climbing, hiking, and running! I am looking forward to pushing our campus community to adopt more sustainable practices - if you have any ideas for events or initiatives, please reach out! :)
