My name is Tavish Comrie and I am one of the two student life commissioners. I am in my second year of engineering and am in geomatics. My favourite things to do when I have free time include playing or watching sports, watching shows or movies, going to the gym, and playing piano. I am also an athlete on the UofC rowing team, am a BC 4-H Ambassador, and am a Community Ambassador in Cascade this year. I hope to see you around!
