Hello! Welcome to Schulich. I’m in my third year of mechanical engineering and business, but I’m also excited to be your VP External! I’ve been in ESS since my first year. You can usually find me in the ESS office (room ENE 134 A) with an energy drink in hand. My job is to manage conference delegations, ESS documents, and the Schulich Engineering Competition. Make sure to get your Junior Design teams ready for October! I’m passionate about helping students get involved. My advice to you? Grades aren’t everything, take care of your mental health, and don’t overextend yourself. At the same time, don’t be afraid to extend yourself a little! This is your community for the next 4 (or more) years. Connect with it. I promise it will pay off. I’m extremely energetic, caffeinated, and outgoing, so feel free to reach out to external@essucalgary.com if you want to get involved or chat!
