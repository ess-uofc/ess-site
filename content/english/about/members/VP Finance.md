Hello, I'm Robert, the Vice President of Finance on ESS. This marks my third year on the council. After completing an internship, I am now entering my final year of Software Engineering. My primary goal this year is to collaborate with the council, as well as various clubs and teams within the Schulich School of Engineering, to provide financial support for events that enhance the student experience. I possess a strong passion for finances and continuously strive to ensure that we achieve the best value for our money. When I'm not focused on school, you can find me tinkering with electronics and brewing coffee. If you ever want to have a conversation about technology, finance, or anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out or find me in the office!
