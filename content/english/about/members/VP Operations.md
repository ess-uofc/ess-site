Hey there! I'm thrilled to introduce myself as your VP Operations this year! My name is Taylor, and I'm passionate about many things including art, staying active, and 3D printing. As a second-year mechanical engineering student, I'm always eager to dive into the world of equations, design, and experiments to understand how things work and find creative solutions to real-world challenges. Being VP Operations I spend a lot of my time working in the ESS Office ensuring that everything is working smoothly and everyone is welcome! I'll be focusing a lot this year on streamlining our store and improving the facilities for all students. I can't wait to see you all, and please feel free to swing by the ESS Office to say hi and check out all the cool things we have in store!
