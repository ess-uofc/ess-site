Hey all! My name is Dennis, and I’ll be the Website Commissioner for this year. I’m entering my final year of electrical engineering with a minor in digital engineering. I love technology and software, which is why I decided to take on the new role of Website Commissioner on this year’s council. Outside of school, I enjoy playing games, watching anime, and hiking. I think that getting involved with the community is one of the best things we can do to make the most of our time here. Having been on the ESS previously, I can say that the team hosts lots of great events throughout the year, so be sure to check them out! I’m excited to have a “normal” uni experience again for my last year after going through so many online and hybrid semesters. Feel free to say hey if you bump into me!
