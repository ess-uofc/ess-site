Sup everyone! My name is Youssef, and I am one of your Social Commissioners this year. I’m entering my second year in a Software Engineering major with a Mechatronics minor. I am very excited to help come up with, organize and run the events this year. This is the first year in a while where COVID shouldn’t influence things much at all (hopefully) which opens up many possibilities for our events. When I’m not doing engineering-related things I’m usually playing video-games, listening to some music, or watching some classic movies. If you see me around feel free to come chat!
