I'm currently in my last year of a combined degree with Electrical Engineering and Math. My hobbies include sports like soccer, golf or anything activity. As someone about to graduate, my advice to first years is to make sure to check out the facilities that our school has to offer such as the pool, climbing wall and squash courts! I've also been involved with ESS since 2019, first as VP Finance, then as Finance Commissioner and now as the Interim VP Operations. If you have any questions about ESS, school or anything don't hesitate to ask. You'll likely find me in the ESS Office or at ESS events.
