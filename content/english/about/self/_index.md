## About the Fund

The Student Experiential Learning Fund (SELF) enables learning opportunities outside the classroom for the clubs and teams of the Schulich School of Engineering (SSE). The Schulich School of Engineering aims to allocate at least $120,000 annually through SELF to improve the Experiential Learning of the Engineering Student. Funds are normally allocated each fiscal year.

Experiential Learning (EL) is learningâ€“by-doing that bridges knowledge and experience through critical reflection. Using intentionally designed and assessed activities, EL enables students to increase understanding, challenge and advance perspectives, clarify values, develop and hone their skills and promote new ways of thinking and doing. These opportunities prepare students to lead and/or respond to change and thrive in an increasingly complex world.
