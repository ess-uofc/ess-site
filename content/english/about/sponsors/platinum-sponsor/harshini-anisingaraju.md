Harshini was born in India and immigrated to Canada when she was 9 years old, calling Calgary home for the last 20 years. She graduated from the University of Calgary with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering and has been working at Fluor Canada since 2018. Working as an E.I.T in the electrical department, she works on engineering design activities and performs Power System Studies for various energy projects. She has also been Fluor’s Executive Sponsor for the University of Calgary since 2023. In 2023, she received the Young Resource Leader award from the Alberta Chamber of Resources for developing a program that aids early career engineers in their P. Eng application. Being a woman in a male-dominated industry, Harshini is determined to re-define norms and serve as a reminder for all the work that’s yet to be done when it comes to diversity and equality.
