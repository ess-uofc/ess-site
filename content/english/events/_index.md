### Frosh Week
Frosh week is the best way to start the year with a BANG! The purpose is to welcome the first years into Schulich as smoothly as possible. This is your opportunity to get to know your classmates, meet upper-year students, and learn a little bit about what it means to be a part of the engineering community before you begin the grind.

### Car Smash
An unconventional fundraising event, the car smash, has always been entertaining for those who wish to relieve themselves from their study stress.

Proceeds go to MADD to support victims of driving under the influence and to raise awareness!

The music plays loud and the good times flow in the Engg Lounge. “POETS has had many themes, from paint night to board games to exchanging bad quiz marks for ice cream. This is a great way to meet friends and unwind after a week of classes. Watch for announcements about POETS throughout the year.
