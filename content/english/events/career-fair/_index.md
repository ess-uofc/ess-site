The Engineering Studentsâ€™ Society (ESS) will be hosting our second in-person Career Fair since the pandemic. Join us on Thursday, February 9th from 9:00 AM - 3:00 pm (MST). You don't have to stay at the event for the full 6 hours; you can pop in and out, as well as drop in when you see the company you really want to speak to!

There will be companies for all majors at Schulich, and this event is for students in ALL years. From local startups to big household names, there will be a wide selection of companies this year! Whether you are looking for a summer, full-year internship, or a new grad job upon graduation, this career fair is the perfect opportunity to network and build industry connections!

You must register to gain access to this event. [Click here to register](https://forms.gle/UxqR35C8tsxUF5s58).
