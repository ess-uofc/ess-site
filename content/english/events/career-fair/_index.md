The Engineering Students' Society (ESS) will be hosting our first (since the pandemic) in person Career Fair on Thursday, October 6th from 9:00 AM - 2:00 pm (MST). You don't have to stay at the event for the full 6 hours; you can pop in and out, as well as drop in when you see the company you really want to speak to!

There will be companies for all majors at Schulich, and this event is for students in ALL years. From local startups to big household names, there will be a wide selection of companies this year! Whether you are looking for a summer, full-year internship, or a new grad job upon graduation, this career fair is the perfect opportunity to network and build industry connections!

You must register to gain access to this event. The registration link is: [essucalgary.com/careerfair2022](https://essucalgary.com/careerfair2022).

To join the career fair as a company, please reach out to Catherine Betancourt Lee at [corporaterelations@essucalgary.com](mailto:corporaterelations@essucalgary.com)!

A list of companies attending shall be posted shortly below!
