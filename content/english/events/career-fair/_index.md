The Engineering Students' Society (ESS) will be hosting a virtual Career Fair on Thursday, October 7th from 9:30 AM - 4:00 pm (MST). You don't have to stay at the event for the full 6 hours; you can pop in and out, just like an in-person career fair. There will be companies for all majors at Schulich, and this event is for students in ALL years. From local startups to big household names, there will be a wide selection of companies this year! Whether you are looking for a summer, full-year internship, or a new grad job upon graduation, this career fair is the perfect opportunity to network and build industry connections!
