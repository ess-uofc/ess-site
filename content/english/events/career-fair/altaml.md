We are experts in ML commercialization and help our industry partners gain a competitive advantage by combining their data and domain expertise with our analytics and ML proficiency. Data informs our every move, and we aim to work quickly, collaboratively, and creatively. We have offices in Edmonton, Calgary and Toronto. AltaML works with progressive partners in industries such as Health, Financial Services and Natural Resources. Sure, we are a tech company, so we offer a well-stocked kitchen including good coffee, sparkling water, and snacks. We are an office filled with foodies and enjoy experiencing different flavours from around the world. We also offer Welcome Lunches, Friday Socials, hot sauce tastings and so much more!
