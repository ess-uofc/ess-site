Catch Engineering has been built on one recurring principle – integrity.

The idea of Catch Engineering began in 2006 when the ability to find a reliable, independent, and effective source of specialized engineering services that focused on the Energy and Utility industries posed a significant challenge.

Building on the strengths of a highly-committed workforce, Catch Engineering was created to complete engineering and design projects for the energy industry at a level of service that was unavailable, and we continue to lead the industry today. By being dedicated to the delivery of value-added systems, exceeding customers’ expectations, and by continuing to meet the customers’ needs, we set the bar for other companies to follow.
