Our mission is to provide innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective engineering solutions tailored to each client's goals.

Clifton, an award-winning engineering and environmental consultancy, opened its doors in 1978 as a four-person engineering start-up. The goal was simple: provide innovative and pragmatic solutions to help our clients build our communities. Forty years later, we are now one of Western Canadaâ€™s most relied upon engineering firms, harnessing regional cutting-edge research and resources to deliver world-class engineering and environmental solutions.

We deliver projects across Western and Northern Canada and internationally.
