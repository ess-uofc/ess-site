Canadian Natural Resources Limited (Canadian Natural) is a senior independent crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production company based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Our strong, diversified asset base is comprised of a balanced portfolio of light, synthetic, and heavy crude oil and natural gas. Canadian Natural operates in Canada, the United Kingdom and Offshore Africa. We are committed to a long-term presence in the communities where we operate. Our activities create value by providing employment, business development opportunities, revenues to governments that contribute to spending on goods and services, and essential resources for public services, including health, safety, education and training.

At Canadian Natural, we incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices that strengthen our long-term sustainability across all aspects of the business. Since 2009, Canadian Natural has invested $3.9 billion in research and development, driving the necessary improvements that will successfully reduce our environmental footprint and set us apart as an ESG leader.

Canadian Natural, along with Canadaâ€™s other largest oil sands producers, have established an unprecedented alliance to help Canada achieve net zero GHG emissions called the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero initiative. As proud Canadian companies, we share the aspiration of Canadians to find realistic and workable solutions to help address the challenge of climate change. Working together with our peers and government will make this goal achievable and more cost effective.
