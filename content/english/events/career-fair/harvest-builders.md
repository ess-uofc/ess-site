Headquartered in Calgary's East Village, Harvest Builders helps remove the barriers to launching and scaling up ventures so that together they  can grow meaningful, globally-competitive companies. Whether they are building a venture from scratch or helping solve a specific business challenge, companies and founders that partner with Harvest gain access to world-class builder services and industry experts who know what it takes to successfully launch and scale new ventures. The Harvest platform is built from the same infrastructure and playbook that scaled SkipTheDishes into one of the largest Canadian tech companies and top 10 consumer brands, launched from right here on the Prairies.
