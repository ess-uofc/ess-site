Ovintiv is one of North America’s oldest oil and natural gas producers. Our roots go back to the late 1800s when workers for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) drilling a water well discovered natural gas. We opted to make use of this newly discovered resource. In 1884, CPR drilled the first producing gas well in Alberta, Canada, to supply railway buildings with natural gas. That well was in use for about 50 years.
