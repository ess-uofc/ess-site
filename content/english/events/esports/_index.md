FROSH is our way of welcoming the new engineering class! Studying can wait, there'll be plenty of time for that later. There's sure to be a FROSH event for you no matter who you are, so be sure to get out there and have some fun before the year gets going! This is a great chance to get to know your classmates and make new friends for the upcoming year. See what to expect and the schedule of events below!
