### Frosh Week
Frosh week is the best way to start the year with a BANG! The purpose is to welcome the first years into Schulich as smoothly as possible. This is your opportunity to get to know your classmates, meet upper-year students, and learn a little bit about what it means to be a part of the engineering community before you begin the grind. Join us as we march along in the Parade, enjoy amazing BBQ, hit each other with dodgeballs, spend the night as we Tap the Town and Escape to Banff.
