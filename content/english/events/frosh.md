Frosh week is the best way to start the year with a BANG! The purpose is to welcome the first years into Schulich in a fun and informative way! This is your opportunity to get to know your classmates, meet upper-year students, and learn a little bit about what it means to be a part of the engineering community before you begin the grind.
