Welcome to the new engineering class! Studying can wait, there'll be plenty of time for that later. For now, the ESS has a lot planned for FROSH 2023. There's sure to be a FROSH event for you no matter who you are, so be sure to get out there and have some fun before the year gets going! This is a great chance to get to know your classmates and make new friends for the upcoming year
