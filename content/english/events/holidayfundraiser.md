# Holiday Fundraiser
ESS needs your help! We want to give back this holiday season, and what better way than to donate to the Calgary Food Bank. Starting December 1st until December 8th, we will be accepting both money and food donations, and all those who donate will automatically be entered into a $150 Visa Gift-card raffle! The Food Bankâ€™s top needs are: Canned Tomatoes, Kraft Dinner, Canned Beans, Canned Fruit, and Peanut Butter, but feel free to bring any of the non-perishables listed above. Come down to the ESS Office anytime during office hours! Happy Holidays!
