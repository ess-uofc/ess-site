Competitors must use analytical techniques to present, with minimum preparation, a reasoned point of view of a resolution that has not been disclosed beforehand. The goal is to assess the competitors' abilities to convey ideas and develop arguments. The purpose is not to assess competitor knowledge of parliamentary procedure and formal debating rules. Therefore, the rules normally used in debates have been modified and relaxed to enable students with no formal debate experience to take part. Note that the Canadian National Style debate format will be used.

Students will compete in teams of two (2).
