This competition challenges junior (first or second year) engineering students to design and build a prototype to address a technical problem. The Junior Team Design category is similar to that of Senior Team Design, but emphasis is placed on prototype functionality rather than design theory.

The design team must comprise a maximum of four (4) competitors. The entire team must be enrolled in their first (1st) or second (2nd) academic year of engineering.
