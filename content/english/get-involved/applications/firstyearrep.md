- • Zoom Announcements
- • Attending weekly ESS meetings as voting members
- • Advertising ESS events
- • Supporting the team as necessary

You will gain experience running events, speaking in public, and join a team of students passionate about creating a positive university experience for others. It is a great learning position on council, and the best way to become involved with ESS in first year engineering.
