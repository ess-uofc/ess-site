We are looking for students who are ready to hit the ground running and want to help ESS provide exceptional events and services to the Engineering students. Becoming a FYR will give you the opportunity to organize and run events, develop your public speaking skills, gain insight into the operation of a student-run society, and become a great student leader!

The main responsibility of the FYR are including but not limited to:

- Liaising between ESS and first year student body
- Block Announcements/Advertising ESS events
- Attending weekly ESS meetings as voting members
- Running the ESS Office during hours of operation
- Variety of special FYR projects/tasks that support the Society
- Supporting the team as necessary

The Selection Process will proceed as follows:

Please bring a personalized and creative project along with you to the tryouts. USE YOUR IMAGINATION; ANYTHING GOES!
