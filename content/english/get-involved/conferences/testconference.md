The Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering Students' Society at the University of Calgary is an organization committed to providing students with a variety of academic and social events to enrich their university experience inside and outside of classes. We strive to provide communication between the University of Calgary faculty and electrical, computer, and software engineering students. Additionally, we work to represent the opinions of students to other universities, and the community at large.

In addition being referred to as the Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering Students Society, our organization has also been referred to as ZOO for over two decades.

Any enquiries for the department organization of Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering should be directed to the relevant department employee. A list of contacts for the department can be found here.

Any enquiries for ZOO should either be voiced in-person at the homeroom, located in ENA 106, or via email to president@zooengg.ca. Questions or comments regarding this site should be directed via email to webmaster@zooengg.ca.
