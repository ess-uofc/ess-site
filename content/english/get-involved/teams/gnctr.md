The Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race (GNCTR) is the largest engineering competition in Canada. Every year, we construct a toboggan capable of holding 5 riders, where the running surfaces must be made out of concrete. Our team is open to all engineering disciplines and first year students, who are then selected to join the travel team for competition every year.
