# Pi Week: Where Math Gets Messy!
**📅 April 4th, 6:30 PM | 📍 MacEwan Hall**  
From torque to twilight, join us after classes to celebrate the end of the school year at our starry night–themed engineering banquet.

**The Theme: Starry Night** While the theme is starry night, you don't have to follow it super closely! It's primarily there to guide the vibe of the event. Our decor features starry elements as well as black, white, and shades of blue.

**What time do I need to be there?** Doors Open at 6:30 PM, and the program starts at 7:15 PM. If you want to secure seats with your friends, please make sure to arrive on time. To enter the event, you will have to provide your full name.
