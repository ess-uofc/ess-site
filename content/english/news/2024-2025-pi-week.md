# Pi Week: Where Math Gets Messy!
**📅 March 10-14 | 📍 Sales in the ENGG Lounge**
Get ready for the most deliciously chaotic event of the year—Pi Week! Grab a pie and pie your friends (or enemies) in the face, all in the name of charity!

**Want revenge?** You can pay to return the pie right back at the original purchaser!

**Consent is required** before pieing anyone; we love chaos, but only the fun kind.
