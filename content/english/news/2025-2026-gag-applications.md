ðŸš¨ The Geers are Gods (GaG) magazine is back! ðŸš¨
Weâ€™re reviving this classic ESS satirical mag to bring you laughs, memes, and all the unfiltered chaos of engineering life.

Got a spicy overheard-in-Engg quote? A ridiculous confession? A meme that deserves eternal glory? Send it our way! Whether itâ€™s a funny article, one-liner, or just pure nonsense, we want it in the next edition of GaG.

ðŸ’¡ All submissions are anonymous (but feel free to drop a name/alias if you want the fame). Got other content ideas? Toss them in the form tooâ€”weâ€™re all ears.

Letâ€™s make Engg hilarious again. ðŸ¤“ðŸ”¥
