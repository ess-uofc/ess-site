The Engineering Student's Society is hosting a mixer for the social clubs and technical teams of Schulich, which will take place on **November 27, 2023** in the **Engineering Atrium from 6:30PM till 9:00PM.** This event is targeted towards a few club representatives from each club for the purpose of providing them opportunities to professionally network with each other, with admin/faculty, as well as with ESS, and learn more about funding opportunities for their club activities.

Please note that **the dress code for the event will be business formal**, and there will be dinner for attendees.
